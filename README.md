### [Pi0h1.com](https://pi0h1.com/ "Pi0h1.com")'s Personal [Half-Life](https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife "Half-Life") build.
#
#### Launch settings
`-game halflife -windowed -noborder`

#### Console commands
`brightness 0.5; gamma 1.8; default_fov 106`

#### The point of this repository
This is essentially a compilation of mods I like to use when playing through *Half-Life*'s main campaign.
It doesn't affect the `valve` folder an instead uses its own `halflife` directory. This is for 2 main reasons:
- It provides a simple installation (Simply clone the repository to your GoldSrc folder).
- It won't affect other GoldSrc games that rely on the `valve` folder

**Author's note**
> I came up with the idea of making this a repository **after** creating this folder, as such there might be mods I forgot to credit due to me not keeping track of it at the beginning.
If you find I used a mod you worked on here and would like to be credited feel free to contact me!
