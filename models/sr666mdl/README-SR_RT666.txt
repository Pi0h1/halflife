folders in your half-life installion.

OPTIONAL:

The default club music is Motley Crue's Girls,Girls,Girls

Zip file contains two other choices.

Juvenille's Back that Ass Up (clubamb_juv)
and
Cardi B's WAP (clubamb_wap)

Simply rename your choice to clubamb and I would suggest 
renaming the original to clubamb_crue so as not to lose it
I left an example line in the RES file.

Res file has comments also regarding this.
Server ops can remove the // lines if they wish to have the 
songs they are not using downloaded to the clients.
